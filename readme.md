# Guess the NBA Player

**Note:** This project is a personal, non-commercial initiative created purely for educational and professional development purposes. It is inspired by my passion for programming and the NBA.

All assets used in this project are sourced from publicly available websites, including NBA.com and Basketball-Reference.com. I do not claim ownership of any logos, images, or data associated with the NBA or its players.


### Overview

Get a silhoutte of a random NBA player and guess who it is in 7 tries! This personal project is to strengthen and showcase my React and Python skills.
